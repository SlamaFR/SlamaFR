# ðŸ¥– Bonjour !

I'm **Irwin Madet**, a french developer. I have a passion for creating full-stack applications that are well-crafted and executed flawlessly.

I enjoy spending my time tinkering with new projects, and always look for ways to challenge myself creatively. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me working on DIY projects around the house.

As a developer, I run an organization called **[Black Kamelia](https://git.black-kamelia.com)**, where we create high-quality applications and libraries that simplify certain tasks.
